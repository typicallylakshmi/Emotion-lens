Project Overview
Emotion-Lens is a deep learning-powered system for real-time emotion detection through facial expressions. Utilizing OpenCV and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the project captures facial features from webcam input and classifies emotions into categories like happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more. It's an ideal foundation for emotion-aware applications in mental health, e-learning, user experience, and human-computer interaction.

Demo
A live webcam-based demo is available upon running the application locally. Users can view real-time emotion predictions rendered directly on their video feed.

Installation
To set up Emotion-Lens on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/typicallylakshmi/Emotion-lens.git
cd Emotion-lens
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python emotion_detector.py
A window will open using your webcam. Detected emotions will be displayed on your face in real-time.

Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascades.

CNN-based emotion classification trained on FER2013 dataset.

Support for seven primary emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

Minimalistic UI with instant feedback.

Custom-trained Keras model for high accuracy and speed.

Dependencies
The project relies on:

opencv-python: For face detection and video streaming.

tensorflow / keras: For deep learning model loading and inference.

numpy: For numerical operations.

matplotlib: (Optional) For plotting training metrics or debugging.

Install with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib

Training (Optional)
To retrain the model:

Download the FER2013 dataset.

Preprocess the dataset and run the model training script (if provided or custom).

Note: Training is resource-intensive and may require a GPU for optimal performance.
